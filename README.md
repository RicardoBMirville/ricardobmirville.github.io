## Introduction

Hello to all those who are taking the time to view this project of mine that I ran over the past month

Health and fitness have been a part of my lifestyle as far as I can remember dating back to my freshman year in college. Back in 2012, I found joy and excitement in walking into the gym and hitting the iron hard with some motivated friends. This pastime activity soon became a huge part of my life to the point where I would feel off on the days that I would miss it. Not only did I enjoy going to the gym and building muscle I also knew for the best results, my diet needed to be clean and healthy. So I always tried my best to eat as healthy as I could. But at that time, I didn’t know too much about macros, proper protein intake, or even what a caloric deficit was. But I generally kept a well-balanced diet with proper exercise. 

Fast forward and we hit the dreadful pandemic that affected people on a global scale. This global lockdown kept some of us away from our families, our jobs, and of course all the fitness centers. Not having access to a gym was tough for a lot of those who go routinely. But of course, you have your select few that made the most with what they had. Their living room became the weight room, their laundry room became their spin sector, and their kids became their emotional support cheerleader. Then there is the other half. The half that felt like all the work that they had put into their bodies and physiques would withstand the two-year lockdown. Those who felt their metabolism would keep them in check so long as they didn’t overdo it. Until the day when they step on that scale and see the huge difference from what they are familiar with. Hopefully, I am not alone in this. 

We fast forward to 2022, with the world finally opening up, including the fitness centers, I hit the gym hard, on a mission to get my health and physique back to what it once was. I lost a lot of the excess body fat and I had regained some of my muscle, but my metabolism isn’t what it once was when I was 19 years old, so getting there will take some time. Over these past two years, I have been eating healthier and getting back into the gym and I’ve once again fully incorporated it into my schedule along with having my diet in check. But this time around I wanted to track my progress. 

My data career kicked off in December of 2023 and after being at my company for a year some change and getting hands-on experience in the data field I wanted to start building my project portfolio to further my skills and development. I thought it would be awesome to analyze data on my fitness journey. I tracked my data from February 1st, 2024 to April 30th, 2024. Every day for the past 3 months I tracked my weight, calorie intake, calories burned, current BMR, and whether I hit the gym or not. Not only did I track those important factors I also wanted to track my measurements as well. I was always told that the scale can be a tricky determiner when it comes to accessing weight loss when you are both trying to lose weight and also put on muscle. 

This project took many forms and I wasn’t truly sure what I wanted to analyze, but I knew that I wanted to monitor daily whether I was in a caloric deficit or not. I was so eager to get started on the project especially after the new year just started and the holiday festivities were done throwing my routine out of wack. But something that should have been done, after realizing a month in, was to head to the doctors and figure out what my body fat percentage was so I could do a before and after. Either way, I wanted to test my SQL skills with the data that I acquired and do some exploratory analysis and find some interesting insights.


## What was used to capture the data:

**I used a standard scale that I used to track my weight in pounds(lbs)**

**I used The app ’Track’ from the app store to track my caloric intake**

**I used apple watch and Apple Fitness App to record my calories burned and daily step count**

**I used ____ to track my bmr that would be adjusted depending on my current weight**
